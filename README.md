# Weather Dashboard

For this app I used APIs for the first time.  I had to use multiple APIs to correctly
display all the information needed.  I generated new content using data retrieved from
APIs.  I used bootstrap to create a basic format for the HTML and I was able to form 
the logic of the page aftr psuedocoding it out for myself.  I took each direction in
 order to help me determine my plan of attack for the Weather Dashboard

## Purpose

This project helped me start to work on my pseudocoding and
planning of a small project to put together a Weather Dashboard
that could display current and future data for the weather.
  This assignment had me struggling at time to grab certain values out
  of the APIs but overall was a good exercise.
